					I/we hereby consent to be assessed for <strong>Community Partners for Safe Families</strong>
					through a conversational interview and discussion of services.
					I/we understand that participation in the Community Partners program is voluntary and that this
					consent may be revoked at any time.
				</p>
				<p>
					The information gathered will include childhood history, stressors, family safety, access to
					resources and health care, as well as other areas to help determine needs.
					Assessment tools may be completed as required by the funding source to help determine needs and
					assist in program evaluation.
				</p>
				<p>
					All information is confidential and will be stored in a statewide database, accessible by agency
					management, staff, and funders.
					This program is funded by the Department of Child Services. Information will only be viewed on a
					“need to know” basis and will not be released to external sources.
					General information on trends and program outcomes will be shared with evaluators, but external
					sources will not have access to specific information without a release.
				</p>
				<p>
					Community Partners is obligated to share information without a participant’s consent if required
					by law, including suspected child abuse and/or neglect.
					Interviews may be observed by management for quality.
				</p>
				<p>
					Signatures below allow for further contact to complete the enrollment process and/or offer other
					supportive services requested by my/our family.
