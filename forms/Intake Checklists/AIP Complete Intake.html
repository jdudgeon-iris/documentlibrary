				<h3>How We May Use and Disclose Information About you:</h3>
				<p>
					The following categories describe different ways that we use and disclose information. For each
					category
					of uses or disclosures we will explain what we mean and try to give some examples. <strong>Not every
						use or
						disclosure in a category will be listed.</strong> However, all the ways we are permitted to use
					and disclose
					information will fall within one of the categories listed below
				</p>

				<h4>For Your Care and Services</h4>
				<p>
					We may use health information about you to provide, coordinate or manage the services, support, and
					healthcare you receive from us and other providers. We may disclose health information about you to
					your medical care providers, your funding agency case manager, your SCAN, Inc. direct support staff,
					other
					agency staff or other peoplewho are involved in supporting you or providing care. For example, your
					direct
					care staff may need to share information about your services with your psychiatrist or with your
					case
					manager.
				</p>
				<h4>For Payment</h4>
				<p>
					We may use and disclose information about you so that services may be billed to and payment may be
					collected from you, an insurance company or other entity providing funding for your care. We may
					also
					tell your health plan about a treatment you are going to receive to obtain prior approval or to
					determine
					whether your plan will cover the treatment. For example, we may need to provide the state funding
					source
					with information about the services we provide so that we can be reimbursed for those services.
				</p>
				<h4>For Health Care/Service Operations</h4>
				<p>
					We may use and disclose information about you to run our program and to make sure you receive
					quality
					services, or to decide if we should change or modify our services. For example, we may disclose
					health
					information about you to train our staff. We may also use information for accreditation or licensing
					activities.
				</p>


				<h4>Release of Information to Family/Advocates</h4>
				<p>
					We may release your health information to an advocate or family member that is helping you pay for
					your
					care or who assists in taking care of you. In addition, we may disclose health information about you
					to an
					entity that is assisting in a disaster relief effort so that your family can be notified about your
					condition,
					status and location. If you have specific objections or instructions regarding these communications,
					you
					may discuss them with us by contacting your service coordinator.
				</p>


				<h4>Research</h4>
				<p>
					We may use and disclose health information about you for research purposes in certain limited
					circumstances. All research projects are subject to a special approval process. Before we use or
					disclose health information
					for research, the project will have been approved through the research approval process. However, we
					may disclose
					health information about you to people preparing to conduct a research project, for example, to help
					them
					look for individuals with specific health needs, so long as the health information they review does
					not
					leave our premises. We will always ask for your specific permission if the researcher requests to
					have
					access to your name, address or other information that reveals who you are or who will be involved
					in
					your care. Your participation in research projects is voluntary
				</p>
				<h4>As Required by Law</h4>
				<p>
					We will disclose information about you when required to do so by federal, state or local law. For
					example, we may reveal information about you to the proper authorities to report suspected abuse or
					neglect.
				</p>
				<h4>To Avert a Serious Threat to Health or Safety</h4>
				<p>
					We may use and disclose information about you when necessary to prevent a serious threat to your
					health and safety or the health and safety of the public or of another person. Any disclosure,
					however,
					would only be to those able to help prevent the threat.
				</p>

					military
					command authorities.

					provide benefits for work related injuries or illnesses.

					</li>
					<li>
						Notification that a person may have been exposed to a disease or may be at risk for contracting

					</li>
					<li>
						Notifications to the appropriate authorities if we believe that you have been the victim of
						abuse,
						neglect or domestic violence
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<h4>Health Oversight Activities</h4>
				<p>
					We may disclose information to a health oversight agency for activities authorized by law. These
					oversight activities include, for example, audits, investigations, inspections, and licensure. These
					activities are necessary for appropriate oversight of the health care system, government programs
					and
					compliance with civil rights laws.
				</p>
				<h4>Lawsuits and Disputes</h4>
				<p>
					If you are involved in a lawsuit or a dispute, or if there is a lawsuit or dispute concerning your
					services,
					we may disclose information about you in response to a court or administrative order. We may also
					disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, discovery request or, other lawful process
					by
					someone else involved in the dispute, but only if efforts have been made to tell you about the
					request or
					to obtain an order protecting the information requested.
				</p>

					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<h4>Coroners, Medical Examiners and Funeral Directors</h4>

					We may release information to a coroner or medical examiner. This may be necessary, for example, to
					identify a decease person or determine the cause of death. We may also release information to
					funeral
