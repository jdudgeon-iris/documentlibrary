                    <strong>Instructions:</strong> The Family Development Interview Guide is a tool designed to assist
                    the Family Development Consultant (FDC) to determine the scores that families receive on the Family
                    Development Matrix. Questions in each section below will serve as prompts for relevant information
                    from families so that the Matrix can be scored. Use the answers to determine the family's threshold
                    in each life area and circle the score that most appropriately corresponds to the Family's
                    condition. In many cases the criteria are self-explanatory, but included below the questions in each
                    section is an explanation where necessary. On completion of all life areas, enter the individual
                    scores into this score sheet of the Matrix and add together for a total score. Further interviewing
                    may be needed to get further background information on the family and to comprehensively complete
                    Action Plans.

                                Divide the

                            Full-time employment is 36 or more hours per week. Underemployed is a situation in which a
                            worker is employed, but not in the desired capacity, whether in terms of compensation,
                            hours, or level of skill or experience. For example, a person earning minimum wage at a
                            full-time job will usually be considered underemployed despite their skill level, because of
                            the low compensation. Likewise, someone possessing a Master's Degree but working at a
                            fast-food restaurant would also be considered underemployed, because their employment does
                            not match their skill level. A Degreed or Professional field refers to an occupation
                            requiring extensive and special education or experience, and usually is accompanied by
                            higher salaries or wages.

                            A family is homeless if they have no housing, particularly if they are living on the streets
                            or in a homeless shelter. Temporary housing is living in transitional housing or with family
                            or friends. The family is vulnerable if they are renting or own a home but are significantly
                            behind in rent or mortgage payments or have received eviction or foreclosure notices. A
                            family is stable if they receive some form of regular assistance with their rental payments.
                            This is typically through public housing or the Housing Choice Voucher Program (formerly
                            Section 8), but also includes any assistance from other organizations that is depended on a
                            regular basis.

                            Food pantries/soup kitchens refer to places a family can go to receive free food to take
                            home or prepared meals. Food subsidies are forms of public assistance for nutritional
                            purposes. These include food stamps, the free and reduced breakfast and lunch program, and
                            WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) program. A family moves to stable if food subsidies and
                            their own income meet the needs of the family (i.e. they don't need to use food pantries or
                            soup kitchens in addition). The family moves to self-sufficient if they do not need food
                            subsidies to meet their needs. A family is thriving if they can typically shop for food of
                            types and brands to their taste, meet basic nutritional requirements, and they have all the
                            cooking utensils they need to prepare meals.

                            Childcare refers to any type of care given to children of the family, which includes school.
                            The family is in crisis if children are left unsupervised or in unsafe care. Childcare is
                            irregular or inconsistent if a family cannot rely on it on a regular basis. A family is
                            stable if they have reliable care but receives financial assistance for the cost of it
                            (school is not considered subsidized care). A family is self-sufficient if they pay for the
                            care on their own but may not be able to afford the care of their choosing.

                            Public Insurance refers to any health insurance that is publicly provided, such as Medicaid,
                            Medicare, Hoosier Healthwise, CHIP, etc. A primary care physician is a first point of
                            contact for health care and is usually a general or family practitioner. Private insurance
                            is any health insurance not publicly provided, like employee health insurance.

                            others, etc.) but it significantly limits their choices in other life areas. This might
                            include a lack of employment
                            opportunities or lack of adequate child care because they can't get to areas where these are

                            get to them conveniently enough. A family is stable if they have a car but it is in danger

                            A family is in crisis if any of their utilities (heating, electricity, water) are
                            disconnected. A family is self-sufficient if
                            they pay their bills consistently but the home is inefficient, thereby increasing their
                            utility burden. This might include
                            lack of insulation, poor air sealing in the home, or inefficient furnaces, water heaters,
                            etc.

                            A family is in crisis if they are isolated from family or community, or if the supportive
                            systems in place have a
                            negative impact on the family (like "friends"that provide access to drugs, or extended
                            family
                            members that borrow
                            money all the time). A family is vulnerable if involved with CPS, DFC, or the court system.
                            These supportive
                            systems, while often viewed as negative and certainly indicative of family issues, do have a
                            positive impact on
                            some element of the family unit. Case managementsupport issupport received by individuals

                            the family to alleviate needs and accomplish goals. They are typically from social service
                            or faith-based
                            organizations. A family is thriving if they give support outside the family unit, which
                            usually indicates that the
                            family's supportive needs have been fully met and have the ability to provide the same to
                            others.

                            negative interaction. "Stability" refers to the stableness of the family unit in the home or

                            which all family members are present on a regular basis. (Divorce, especially immediately
                            following, constitutes a
                            lack of stability in the home.) Positive interaction is a caring environment, open
                            communication, positive support
                            for all members, etc. A family is thriving if it has a full history of positive interaction
                            and includes a full history of
                            stability in the household (in most cases divorce, domestic abuse, or neglect has a negative

                            This life area is primarily a yes or no answer, but the thresholds beyond crisis refer to
                            the likelihood that the addictive behavior will return. In general, the more treatment a
                            person receives and the
                            more time that passes since the addictive behavior, it is less likely there will be a
                            relapse. If a person has ever been
                            "addicted" to something, regardless of how much time since, they are more likely to relapse
                            than someone who has
                            never suffered from the addiction. Thus, only families with no history of abuse can truly be
                            thriving
