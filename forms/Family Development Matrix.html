                    <strong>Instructions:</strong> The Family Development Interview Guide is a tool designed to assist
                    the Family Development Consultant (FDC) to determine the scores that families receive on the Family
                    Development Matrix. Questions in each section below will serve as prompts for relevant information
                    from families so that the Matrix can be scored. Use the answers to determine the family's threshold
                    in each life area and circle the score that most appropriately corresponds to the Family's
                    condition. In many cases the criteria are self-explanatory, but included below the questions in each
                    section is an explanation where necessary. On completion of all life areas, enter the individual
                    scores into this score sheet of the Matrix and add together for a total score. Further interviewing
                    may be needed to get further background information on the family and to comprehensively complete
                    Action Plans.

                                family of four in 2017 is $2050 (the "poverty level" is considered 100% of Poverty).
                                Divide the

                            Full-time employment is 36 or more hours per week. Underemployed is a situation in which a
                            worker is employed, but not in the desired capacity, whether in terms of compensation,
                            hours, or level of skill or experience. For example, a person earning minimum wage at a
                            full-time job will usually be considered underemployed despite their skill level, because of
                            the low compensation. Likewise, someone possessing a Master's Degree but working at a
                            fast-food restaurant would also be considered underemployed, because their employment does
                            not match their skill level. A Degreed or Professional field refers to an occupation
                            requiring extensive and special education or experience, and usually is accompanied by
                            higher salaries or wages.
