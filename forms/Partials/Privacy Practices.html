        The following categories describe different ways that we use and disclose information. For each
        category
        of uses or disclosures we will explain what we mean and try to give some examples. <strong>Not every
            use or
            disclosure in a category will be listed.</strong> However, all the ways we are permitted to use
        and disclose
        information will fall within one of the categories listed below
    </p>

    <h4>For Your Care and Services</h4>
    <p>
        We may use health information about you to provide, coordinate or manage the services, support, and
        healthcare you receive from us and other providers. We may disclose health information about you to
        your medical care providers, your funding agency case manager, your SCAN, Inc. direct support staff,
        other
        agency staff or other peoplewho are involved in supporting you or providing care. For example, your
        direct
        care staff may need to share information about your services with your psychiatrist or with your
        case
        manager.
    </p>
    <h4>For Payment</h4>
    <p>
        We may use and disclose information about you so that services may be billed to and payment may be
        collected from you, an insurance company or other entity providing funding for your care. We may
        also
        tell your health plan about a treatment you are going to receive to obtain prior approval or to
        determine
        whether your plan will cover the treatment. For example, we may need to provide the state funding
        source
        with information about the services we provide so that we can be reimbursed for those services.
    </p>
    <h4>For Health Care/Service Operations</h4>
    <p>
        We may use and disclose information about you to run our program and to make sure you receive
        quality
        services, or to decide if we should change or modify our services. For example, we may disclose
        health
        information about you to train our staff. We may also use information for accreditation or licensing
        activities.

        to an
        entity that is assisting in a disaster relief effort so that your family can be notified about your
        condition,
        status and location. If you have specific objections or instructions regarding these communications,
        you
        may discuss them with us by contacting your service coordinator.

        them
